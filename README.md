### Read Me
This website project is my first attempt at implementing new react concepts I have learned. This website serves as a portfolio to host my most recent projects and give a short intro to who I am and what I find interesting.

## Important!
This website is based off of Soumyajit4419 template (https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio). I will be using this template until I complete my own website template.
